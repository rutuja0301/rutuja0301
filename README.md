# 👋 Hi, I'm Rutuja Hande

I'm a passionate and curious **Python Developer** with over 2.5 years of hands-on experience in building robust backend systems, APIs, and full-stack applications. I enjoy solving real-world problems with clean, efficient code — and occasionally adding a splash of UI magic when needed!

## 🚀 What I Do

- 🧠 Develop scalable applications using **Python**, **Flask**, **Django**, and **FastAPI**
- 🌐 Build modern UIs using **React.js**, **JavaScript**, and **HTML/CSS**
- 📦 Design and integrate **RESTful APIs** and handle **API integrations**
- 🛠️ Work with **SQL & NoSQL** databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and DynamoDB
- ☁️ Deploy applications on **AWS**, **GCP**, and use services like EC2, S3, Lambda, IAM, Cloud Run
- 🔄 Embrace **CI/CD**, Docker, Jenkins, Git, and Agile best practices
- 🧪 Write unit tests and automate where possible

## 🧰 Tech Stack

| 💻 Languages | 🧪 Frameworks | ☁️ Cloud/Tools |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS | Flask, Django, FastAPI, ReactJS | AWS, GCP, Docker, Git, Jenkins, Postman |
| SQL, MongoDB, GraphQL | Redux, Bootstrap | VS Code, JIRA, CloudAMQP |

## 🛠️ Projects & Highlights

- ✅ Deployed a BERT-based NER ML model using **Google Cloud Run** for telecom automation
- ✅ Designed a microservice setup using **RabbitMQ** with Django + Flask integration


## 🎯 Currently Exploring

- 🧠 LLMs & Generative AI
- 🌐 Event-driven architecture
- 🪄 Python Asyncio & Advanced API design
- 📈 Scalable backend systems using microservices

## 💬 Let's Connect!

I'm always up for a tech chat, mentoring, or contributing to open-source. If you have an idea, let's build it together!
